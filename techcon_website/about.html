            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2010 as a small gathering of 50 passionate technologists in a modest conference room in Silicon Valley. Founded by a group of visionary entrepreneurs who believed in the power of knowledge sharing, the conference was born from a simple idea: bringing together brilliant minds to discuss the future of technology.</p>

            <p>Over the past 14 years, TechCon has evolved into one of the world's premier technology conferences, attracting over 10,000 attendees annually from more than 60 countries. What started as discussions about mobile computing and social media has expanded to encompass artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain technology, and sustainable tech solutions.</p>
